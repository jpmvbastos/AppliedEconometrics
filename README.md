# Applied Econometrics 3
 
This repository contains codes for projects and homeworks for Applied Econometrics 3 (AAEC6317) course at Texas Tech University. 

```MonteCarlo_Simulations.ipynb``` applies common econometrics techniques to data generating processes under the standard assumptions for Gauss-Markov theorem, as well as when those are violated: endogeneity, heteroskedasticity, auto-correlation.


## [Homework 1](https://github.com/jpmvbastos/AppliedEconometrics3/tree/main/Homework1)
[Homework1.ipynb](https://github.com/jpmvbastos/AppliedEconometrics3/blob/main/Homework1/Homework1.ipynb) apply Maximum Likelihood techniques to different data generating processes, also relying on Stata for some estimations (Box-Cox demand, ```boxcox```, and  Finite Mixture Models, ```fmm```). The file [Homework1.do](https://github.com/jpmvbastos/AppliedEconometrics3/blob/main/Homework1/Homework1.ipynb) has the replication code for Stata. [data_1.xlsx](https://github.com/jpmvbastos/AppliedEconometrics3/blob/main/Homework1/data_1.xlsx) is replication data for question 1, [data_2.xlsx](https://github.com/jpmvbastos/AppliedEconometrics3/blob/main/Homework1/data_2.xlsx) for question 2.
