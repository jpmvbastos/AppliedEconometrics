# Applied Econometrics 3
 
This repository contains codes for projects and homeworks for Applied Econometrics 3 (AAEC6317) course at Texas Tech University. 

```MonteCarlo_Simulations.ipynb``` applies common econometrics techniques to data generating processes under the standard assumptions for Gauss-Markov theorem, as well as when those are violated: endogeneity, heteroskedasticity, auto-correlation.

```Homework1.ipynb``` apply Maximum Likelihood techniques to different data generating processes, also relying on Stata for some estimations. The file ```Homework.do``` has the replication code for Stata. ```data_1.xlsx``` is replication data for question 1, ```data_2.xlsx``` for question 2.
